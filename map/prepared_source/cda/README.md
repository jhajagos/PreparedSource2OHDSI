## C-CDA and Healthkit CDA to Prepared Source Format to the OHDSI Common Data Model (CDM)

An individual will see multiple providers across different health systems. 
Most patient portals now support export of medical records to the C-CDA format. 
C-CDA is a templated version of the CDA (Clinical Document Architecture)
This code is designed to take a collection of C-CDAs (Consolidated Clinical 
Document Architecture) and map them to the Prepared Source Format (PSF). The code
also supports the extraction of vitals from Apple Health Kit CDA export

The is a demonstration project for understanding the complexity of combining multiple 
data sources into a standardized CDM for analytics.
